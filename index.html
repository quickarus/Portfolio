                                <p class="testimonial-text">"Adam was one of my students in the UX/UI Bootcamp that I taught for George Washington University. Very rarely have I had the pleasure of teaching such a great student. He is bright, inquisitive, extremely quick-thinking, and fast on his (mental) feet. I have never had a design student pick up front-end development so quickly, and even better still: I have never had any student who took advantage of brand-new and emerging AI tools to the degree that Adam did. He has the type of mindset for a design engineer role: someone who understands all of UX/UI design and why it's important, a great eye for visual design, the foresight to design for all users and edge cases, and a mind that can work through complex problems at light speed and adapt to the rapidly-changing tech world. On top of all that, he is fantastic with soft skills and a real team player - the kind of guy that you really want on your team. Adam is the full package. This is the new and emerging designer that you want to hire."</p>

He made an incredible effort to understand how I wanted it to look and how I wanted it laid out. My website is often times the first thing potential clients will see and therefor very important to my business. Adam took the time to get to know my business and how it needed to be presented, and worked closely with me to thoughtfully build the look we needed while creating an easy to navigate site for clients. Highly recommend!"</p>

                <p>My greatest strength as a designer is my ability to empathize with users to understand and define problems. I developed skills through my experience creating databases and reporting structures for clients at a boutique consultancy, and I have worked to sharpen them in a UX-specific manner through the case studies below. I'm passionate about creating user-friendly, intuitive designs that help both stakeholders and users achieve their goals efficiently. While design is my primary focus, I have also worked hard to build front-end development skills, which are displayed below as well as in my Github profile.</p>
                <p>Originally from Connecticut, I now live in Washington, D.C. with my cat, Stevie. Some hobbies include hiking, running, golfing, listening to music, learning about history, and watching sports. I took the background photos throughout the site on a few of my favorite hikes!</p>
